# PeterLeslie.BlazorDemo

1. Open .sln in visual studio 2019/2022
2. Run PeterLeslie.BlazorDemo blazor app.
3. Notice how PeterLeslie.BlazorDemo.Startup.cs:34 throws an exception.

This is not how you should use fluent validator though, however it would be useful to have a meaningful exception message when a developer makes a mistake like how I did in this demo in Validators.Class1.cs
